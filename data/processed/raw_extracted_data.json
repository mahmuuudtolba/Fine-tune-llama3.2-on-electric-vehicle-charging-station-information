      "text": "Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: What you need to know from your Insurance Agency\nWhat are EV charging stations and how do they work?\nAn electric vehicle charging station or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is an electrical power source to which plug-in vehicles connect. The electrical energy is stored in a battery which provides power to the vehicle until the energy is depleted. Electric vehicle charging stations are commonly found at retail buildings, office buildings, all types of parking facilities and even at some coops, condos, and apartment buildings.\nTypes of Charging Stations\nThere are three types of charging stations available: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. All electrical vehicles come with a cable which connects into an electrical outlet. The charging requirements determine the type of charging station that should be installed.\nA standard charging station, whether it is Level 1 (120V) or Level 2 (240V), will provide pass through AC power from the power grid and a safety earth ground to the vehicle for charging. The vehicle converts this AC power to DC power and uses that to recharge the batteries. Though the actual \"battery charger\" is on the vehicle, an EVSE \"charging station\" implements several layers of redundant safety features to protect the user from potential electrical and fire hazards while connecting, disconnecting, and charging the vehicle. Once connected to the vehicle, the station informs the vehicle that power is available and at what level. The vehicle then takes over, initiates, and takes full control of the power transfer. If an electrical fault occurs, the station will stop the power transfer immediately and de-energize the cable.\nTypes of Chargers\nLEVEL 1 (120 VOLT CHARGING)\nLevel 1 is the slowest method but sufficient for drivers who charge overnight and travel 30-40 miles per day. All electric cars come with a cable that can be plugged into a standard wall outlet with no equipment installation required. Level 1 works well at home, work or anywhere - when you have sufficient time to charge. Level 1 charging is ideal for plug in hybrid electric cars that have smaller batteries, but it can suffice for some battery electric car owners as well, depending on their daily range needs and length of time typically parked and charging. Level 1 charging adds about 3.5 - 6.5 miles of driving range per hour of charging time.\nLEVEL 2 (220/240 VOLT CHARGING)\nLevel 2 charging is considerably fast but requires installing a charging station also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Charging station installation requires a dedicated 240-volt or 208-volt electrical circuit, similar to what is required for a clothes dryer or electric range. Level 2 is found at many public and workplace charging stations and in many homes. It uses the same standard connector as Level 1 charging meaning any electric car can plug in at any Level 2 charger. Depending on battery type, charger configuration and circuit capacity, Level 2 charging adds about 14-35 miles of range per hour of charging time.\nLEVEL 3 DIRECT CURRENT (DC) FAST CHARGING (480-VOLT CHARGING)\nDC fast charging provides the fastest available fill-up. It requires a 480-volt connection making DC fast charging unsuitable for home use and not every electric car model is equipped for it. Stations offering DC fast charging are found in shopping centers and often along major travel corridors, allowing electric car drivers to charge up quickly and take longer trips. DC fast chargers come with a CHAdeMO, Combined Charging System (Combo or CCS) or Tesla connector system. Most DC fast chargers will have both the CHAdeMO and Combo connectors. Depending on the battery type, charger configuration and circuit capacity, DC fast charging can add up to 10 miles of range per minute of charging time.\nAC versus DC Charging\nRisk Reduction: Best practices for operation and maintenance of the EVSE\nSafety Certification:\nNot all EVSEs available on the market are independently safety tested and certified. To ensure that the products have been properly safety tested, it is important to verify that a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) has certified it. Intertek and Underwriter's Laboratory are most common NRTLs in North America that can test and certify EVSEs.\nNon-Grounded Plugs:\nPlug in charging stations with NEMA 10-30 and 10-50 style plugs should not be used as these types of outlets do not have an earth ground connection. EVSEs that use these plugs will not be NRTL safety certified because the absence of proper grounding makes it possible for the vehicle chassis to become electrified and could pose a safety hazard upon contact with the vehicle during or after charging.\nElectrical Infrastructure:\nWhen installing a charging station, the building's current electrical capabilities may not allow for safe installation of a charger. Additional electrical circuits may be required to handle the increased electrical load.\nLocation Selection:\nWhen selecting an installation site, consider the path of the charging cord when in use so it is not a tripping hazard. When comparing the EVSE models, consider units with the charging cord being mounted 5' or higher to prevent a trip hazard. Some parking lot management questions to consider include:\nWill the EVSE get in the way of pavement cleaning or snow plowing?\nIs it a space where snow is piled in the winter?\nIs equipment stored nearby that might block access to it?\nPhysical Damage Protection:\nMost charging station repairs are due to damage from vehicles. Some form of charging station protection should be used to vehicles from hitting the station or snagging the charging cords. Mounting the station above the bumper level on a wall or curb is helpful, but a tire-stop or bollard would provide added protection.\nCord Storage:\nA common issue involving EVSEs is improperly stored charging cords being damaged by other vehicles. Charging stations with cord retraction systems help alleviate cord damage from vehicles.\nRoutine Cleaning and Inspection:\nAll charging stations require occasional cleaning and should have the cords inspected once a month and everything wiped down quarterly or monthly depending on use. Snow should be cleared from around the charging station so it can vent properly and be easily accessed.\nElectric Vehicle Station Servicing\nAny EVSE should be professionally serviced as per manufacturer recommendations. Below is a system inspection process that a typical service technician may follow.\nPerform Visual Inspection - A service technician will inspect the charging station(s) to ensure that all system components are clean and functioning within designed specifications.\nPerform Environment Inspection - A service technician will verify and document that the systems environment is within specified operating conditions.\nPerform Mechanical/Electrical Inspection - A service technician will inspect the charging connections and operational control.\nImplement Updates - A service technician will verify and implement all required Field Advisories and Field Modifications.\nPrepare and Deliver Report - A service technician will describe the current condition and make recommendations for corrective action if required. A detailed report will be provided.\nLEVEL 1 OR 2 EVSE MAINTENANCE\nReplacement of charge cord due to vandalism (if not covered under warranty).\nReplacement of EVSE unit at the end of its useful life (industry experts predict a lifespan of 10 years).\nFor networked units add:\nCost of technician troubleshooting (if not covered in network subscription fees)\nCost of manual resets for software malfunctions\nDSFC MAINTENANCE\nDC Fast Charging (DCFC) stations require more maintenance, typically, there are relatively few EVSE maintenance requirements:\nIt is important to establish a warranty and service plan that fits the machine(s) requirements considering usage and site-specific needs.\nDCFC units require ongoing maintenance because they have cooling systems, filters, and other components that do not exist in Level 1 or Level 2 units.\nIn general, the charging cord should be stored securely so it is not damaged, the accessible EVSE parts should be checked periodically for wear and the system should be kept clean,\nSee the EVSE manufacturer's guidelines for specific requirements. Periodic inspection, testing, and preventative maintenance by a qualified contractor may be recommended.\nSources Cited\nHere's What You Need to Know About EV Charging Station Safety -\nchargedevs.com\nMaintenance for EV Charging Stations: What to Know About EV Charger Repair -\nlibertyplugins.com\nBest Practices Guide: Site Owners of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations on Commercial Properties -\nNYSERDA\nElectric Car Charging Overview -\ndriveclean.ca.gov\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Services -\nUL.com\nCustomer Segments: Energize my eMobility world -\nnew.siemens.com\nElectric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure -\nmpoweruk.com\nLiterature Review Summary: Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Signage Guidance -\nEnergetics Incorporated\nSubmitting a Claim to GNY\nTo submit a claim after a Electric Vehicle Station loss refer to the guides\nhere\n.\nThe content herein is for informational purposes only without warranty of any kind, whether express, statutory, or implied, and the information contained herein does not constitute legal advice.

      "text": "Sponsored by ClipperCreek\nAfter deciding to buy a plug-in electric vehicle, often the next decision is to purchase a\nLevel 2 charging station\nfor faster charging at home. The technical name as defined in the National Electric Code for these products is EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment), commonly called charging stations.\nSafety might not be the first consideration when selecting a charging station, but safety is actually the most important thing to consider. The primary function of a plug-in vehicle charging station is to provide electrical safety for the operator and electrical infrastructure throughout the charging process and specifically to address the risks of fire and electric shock.\nA standard home charging station, whether it is a\nLevel 1 (120V) station\nor a\nLevel 2 (240V) station\n, will provide pass through AC power from the power grid and a safety earth ground to the vehicle for charging. The vehicle converts this AC power to DC power and uses that to recharge the batteries. Though the actual “battery charger” is on the vehicle, an EVSE “charging station” implements several layers of redundant safety features to protect the user from potential electrical and fire hazards while connecting, disconnecting, and charging the vehicle. Once connected to the vehicle, the station informs the vehicle that power is available and at what level. The vehicle then takes over, initiates and takes full control of the power transfer.  If an electrical fault occurs the station will stop the power transfer immediately and de-energize the cable.\nCharging is really safe with the right equipment\nThe good news is, charging an electric vehicle is actually very safe and easy when done with proper, independently safety certified equipment. The challenge is that not ALL charging stations on the market are independently safety tested and certified.\nWhen a\ncharging station manufacturer\ndevelops a new product, or makes even a minor change to an existing product, they should send samples to a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory, such as Intertek (ETL mark) or Underwriter’s Laboratory (UL mark). Safety engineers at these labs perform months of extensive safety testing that the products must pass before they can be safety certified and made available to the public for sale.  Only products with these marks appearing on the manufactured product’s rating plate are safety certified.\nEVSE manufacturers invest heavily in this third party safety testing. The laboratory safety engineers test the products against thousands of applicable electrical codes and safety standards. Intertek and Underwriter’s Laboratory are the most common NRTLs in North America that can test and certify electric vehicle charging stations.\nFor more information, click here.\nAfter passing all the testing and getting a product safety certified the charging station manufacturer’s factory is then randomly inspected four times a year by the National Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) that did the testing and issued the certification. The NRTL field inspection staff ensures the products being sold are constructed in the same manner as the samples that were tested. Changes cannot be made to the products without going back through the certification process.\nAll this testing, independent validation, and facility inspection is completed and the right to apply the marks are given by the NRTLs\nbefore\nthe products are sold for people to use.\nNRTL listing is a requirement of the National Electric Code\nThe National Electric Code (NEC) comes from the National Fire Protection Agency. These are the standards to which buildings and equipment must meet minimum regulatory safety requirements in order to be safe enough for the general public to install and use.  The NEC absolutely requires any charging station to be NRTL certified in order to be installed anywhere in the US. This is also the case for the CEC or Canadian Electric Code in Canada. In most places, installing an EVSE requires a building permit. One reason for a permit is to provide the opportunity for a building inspector to verify that the charging station is NRTL listed and that the electrical installation meets all other applicable aspects of the NEC and therefore the equipment is safe to use.\nThese standards and practices exist to protect public welfare. It is common practice for all electrical appliances. EVSEs are very high power energy transfer equipment operated daily by the home owner and should be handled accordingly.\nHow to tell if a charging station is safety certified\nA consumer needs to look for the official marks from a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory symbols (ETL or UL) ON the product itself.\nThese marks cannot be put on the product unless the product has passed the rigorous testing of a certified third-party NRTL and the manufacturer consistently passes the random factory inspections. The NRTL mark has to appear ON the products – not on a website, or a vague statement in a manual or product specification. The local building inspector will ONLY approve a charging station installation if the certification mark is visible ON the product.\nThe marks will appear on a certified product’s name plate, also called the rating plate. This is actually a durable marking that holds specific information required by the NEC and NRTL Safety Standards including the power and voltage ratings, the manufacturer of origin, part numbers, warnings, and, of course, the ever-important Certification Mark. Look for this plate on the product. If it is not there and the correct certification marks are not present, do not install the product.\nThe building inspector will look for this plate to make sure the product has been installed according to its certification. These rating plates are common on all electrical appliances.\nHere are examples of correct rating plates:\nBe cautious of these things:\nDeceptive markings\nSome manufacturers use official-looking marks that are deceptive. A common mark is a CE logo. If you\nonly\nsee a CE mark then the product has not been independently certified. CE is a self-certifying mark; it is not the mark of a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory, and it should not be trusted in the US, Canada, and Mexico. A CE mark\nin addition\nto the UL or ETL mark is acceptable.  Underwriters Laboratory and Intertek both have online resources that allow the public and the building inspectors to verify the marks applied to a product are not counterfeit. Public safety is serious business.\nDo NOT use a product that\nonly\nhas a CE mark\nUncertified products are sold by what seem like reputable sellers\nBuying the product from what SEEMS to be a reputable seller doesn’t mean the charging station has been safety certified. Most large home improvement retailer stores like Lowes and Home Depot would likely never carry any electrical item or appliance in their store that was not NRTL certified appropriately. However, there are online retailers, such as Amazon, direct sellers, and sources from outside the United States that DO carry and sell unlisted products.\nDeceptive claims\nBe cautious of advertising statements such as “built to UL/ETL/NRTL standards,” or “built with UL/ETL/NRTL listed components.” Typically, products that have been NRTL certified will indicate such clearly in their advertising materials and specifications with specific terms like “UL/ETL/ NRTL listed,” or “Certifications: UL/ETL/NRTL.”  When selecting a charging station, if you are unsure about the NRTL certification status of a product, reach out to the product supplier and ask them to provide confirmation that the product you are interested in is NRTL (UL or ETL) certified. The charging station manufacturer or supplier should be able to easily refer you to an online directory where you can confirm the up to date certification. When you receive the product, look for the NRTL certification mark on the rating plate. If it is not on the product, do not use it and return to the seller.\nNon-grounded plugs\nIf you are purchasing a\nplug-in charging station\n,\ndon’t ever\nbuy a station with a NEMA 10-30 or 10-50 plug.\nThe NEMA 10-30 and NEMA 10-50 style outlets do not have an earth ground connection. There is no possibility that a charging station delivered with one of these plugs is properly NRTL safety certified. One of the key safety functions of a charging station is providing an earth ground connection to the vehicle. This assures the vehicle body is safely grounded during charging. Charging stations must have a connection to earth ground!\nDo not ever use a charging station with a NEMA 10-30 or NEMA 10-50 plug. The station above has a NEMA 10-30 plug. It has no safety ground.\nEV charging is safe and easy\nCharging your electric vehicle can be safe and easy, but don’t take chances. Select a safety certified station! Just as you wouldn’t drive a car that wasn’t crash tested, don’t charge your car with a charging station that hasn’t been tested by an NRTL with an active right to apply the mark status. Remember to look for the ETL or UL certification marks when shopping for a charging station.\nDo you want to know more about Staying Safe?

      "text": "Electric Car Charging Overview\nElectric Car Charging is Easy\nImagine never stopping at a gas station again, and instead, have an unlimited supply of fuel available at home or wherever you normally park. For many electric car drivers, this is a reality. Battery-electric cars never need gas, and for short trips, plug-in hybrids might use no gas.\nElectric car charging is simple, cost-effective and convenient, particularly when you are plugged in at home—filling up your car even while you’re asleep. How long it takes to charge depends on the charging equipment and the size of the car’s battery and its available charging capacity.\nAlthough electric car drivers primarily charge at home, workplace and public chargers are increasingly available in communities nationwide. Use the\nEV Charging Station Map\nto find nearby charging.\nLevel 1 Charging\nLevel 1 is the slowest method, but sufficient for drivers who charge overnight and travel 30-40 miles per day. All electric cars come with a cable that can be plugged into a standard wall outlet with no equipment installation required.

Explore electric car types and differences in our\nelectric car overview\n.\nDepending on battery type, charger configuration and circuit capacity, DC fast charging can add up to 10 miles of range per minute of charging time\n.\nElectric Car Charging Costs\nCost of Installing a Charger at Home\nIf you decide to install a Level 2 charger at home, the installation costs will depend on the system you select, permitting fees in your area and your home’s configuration.\nIncentives\nmay be available to offset these expenses.\nCost to Charge at Home\nCharging costs depend on your electric car’s battery size and the local price of electricity. Most electric utilities offer special time-of-use (TOU) rates that greatly reduce costs by billing less for electricity used during off-peak hours. Contact your electric utility to find out more. Find out how simple home charging is for current\nelectric car drivers\n.\nWhile electricity costs vary, the average price in California is about 18 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). At this price, charging an electric car such as the Nissan LEAF with a 40-kWh battery with a 150-mile range would cost about $7 to fully charge. Meanwhile, fueling a 25-mpg gas vehicle at a gas price of $4.30 per gallon would cost about $26 for enough gas to drive approximately 150 miles. Saving money on fuel is just one of the many\nbenefits of driving electric\n.\nPublic Charging Costs\nMany people charge their electric car at public charging stations. They can be free, pay-as-you-go or subscription-based, with prices set by networks or property owners. Some automakers, such as Hyundai, Nissan and Tesla may provide complimentary public charging at certain chargers. The industry is moving toward a fee structure based on kWh used, rather than by the time it takes to charge the car.\nDrivers in California may expect to pay 30 cents per kWh to charge on Level 2, and 40 cents per kWh for DC fast charging. At these rates, the same Nissan LEAF with a 150-mile range and 40-kWh battery would cost about $12 to fully charge (from empty to full) using Level 2, and $16 with DC fast charging.\nSeveral apps and online tools will help you locate public charging, including\nPlugShare's\ninternational database.\nCharging Station Rebates\nRebates for Residential Level 2 Charging Stations\nMany California electric utility providers and air districts offer rebates to make home Level 2 charging more affordable. Find\navailable incentives\nwhere you live.\nRebates for Commercial Electric Car Charging Stations\nProperty owners that install public commercial charging stations may be eligible for rebates. Electric car charging can attract more traffic to your business, improve tenant or employee satisfaction and retention, and generate a new revenue stream (fees for charging). Find information on\nrebate eligibility and funding availability\n.",

For this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in\nAC-to-DC converter\ncommonly known as the \"onboard charger\" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.\nPublic charging stations\n[\nedit\n]\nFred Meyer\nparking area\nPublic charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas.

Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.\n[\n1\n]\nNomenclature\n[\nedit\n]\nCharging station and vehicle terminology\nIn 2011, the\nEuropean Automobile Manufacturers Association\n(ACEA) defined the following terms:\n[\n2\n]\nSocket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle\nPlug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.\nCable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle\nConnector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet\nVehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power\nThe terms \"electric vehicle connector\" and \"electric vehicle inlet\" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States\nNational Electrical Code\n(NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term \"electric vehicle supply equipment\" as the entire unit \"installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle\", including \"conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses\".\n[\n3\n]\nTesla, Inc.\nuses the term\ncharging station\nas the location of a group of chargers, and the term\nconnector\nfor an individual EVSE.\n[\n4\n]\nVoltage and power\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly standards\n[\nedit\n]\nNEC(1999) levels\n[\n5\n]\n: 9\nMethod\nMaximum supply\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\nLevel 1 (\n1-phase\nAC)\n12\n120\n1.44\n16\n120\n1.92\n24\n120\n2.88\nLevel 2 (1-phase AC)\n32\n208/240\n7.68\nLevel 3 (\n3-phase\nAC)\n400\n480\n332.6\nThe National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the\nElectric Power Research Institute\nwith members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the United States;\n[\n6\n]\nearly work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999\nNational Electrical Code\n(NEC) Handbook.\n[\n5\n]\n: 9\nUnder the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard\nNEMA 5\n-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a\nground-fault circuit interrupter\nwas required within 12 in (30 cm) of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16\namperes\n(\"amps\" or \"A\") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20 A.\n[\n5\n]\n: 9\nLevel 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40 A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.\n[\n5\n]\n: 9\nFor convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle (\nMagne Charge\n) or a conductive connector (\nAvcon\n).\n[\n5\n]\n: 10–11, 18\nLevel 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle\nrectifier\nto convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.\n[\n5\n]\n: 9\nSAE\n[\nedit\n]\nSAE J1772(2017) levels\n[\n7\n]\nMethod\nMaximum supply\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\nAC Level 1\n12\n120\n1.44\n16\n120\n1.92\nAC Level 2\n80\n208–240\n19.2\nDC Level 1\n80\n50–1000\n80\nDC Level 2\n400\n50–1000\n400\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (\nSAE International\n) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard\nSAE J1772\n, initially developed in 2001.\n[\n8\n]\nSAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.\nAlternating current (AC)\n[\nedit\n]\nAC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.\n[\n8\n]\nAC Level 1\n: Connects directly to a standard 120\nV North American outlet; capable of supplying 6–16\nA (0.7–1.92\nkilowatts or \"kW\") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.\nAC Level 2\n: Uses 240\nV (single phase) or 208\nV (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80\nA (1.4–19.2\nkW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.\nDirect current (DC)\n[\nedit\n]\nCommonly, though incorrectly, called \"Level 3\" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nDC Level 1\n: Supplies a maximum of 80\nkW at 50–1000\nV.\nDC Level 2\n: Supplies a maximum of 400\nkW at 50–1000\nV.\nAdditional standards released by SAE for charging include\nSAE J3068\n(three-phase AC charging, using the\nType 2 connector\ndefined in\nIEC 62196\n-2) and\nSAE J3105\n(automated connection of DC charging devices).\nIEC\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2003, the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission\n(IEC) adopted a majority of the\nSAE J1772\nstandard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.\nIEC 61851-1 modes\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nMode\nType\nMaximum supply\nCurrent (A)\nVoltage (V)\nPower (kW)\n1\n1Φ AC\n16\n250\n4\n3Φ AC\n16\n480\n11\n2\n1Φ AC\n32\n250\n7.4\n3Φ AC\n32\n480\n22\n3\n1Φ AC\n63\n250\n14.5\n3Φ AC\n63\n480\n43.5\n4\nDC\n200\n400\n80\nThe IEC alternatively defines charging in\nmodes\n(\nIEC 61851\n-1):\nMode 1\n: slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or\nthree-phase\nAC)\nMode 2\n: slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the\nPark & Charge\nor the PARVE systems)\nMode 3\n: slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e.\nSAE J1772\nand\nIEC 62196\n-2)\nMode 4\n: DC\nfast charging\nusing a specific charging interface (i.e.\nIEC 62196\n-3, such as\nCHAdeMO\n)\nThe connection between the electric grid and \"charger\" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):\nCase A:\nany charger connected to the\nmains\n(the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.\nCase B:\nan on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle – usually mode 3.\nCase C:\nDC dedicated charging station.

It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality.\nAs of November 2023, automakers\nFord\n,\nGeneral Motors\n,\nRivian\n,\nVolvo\n,\nPolestar\n,\nMercedes-Benz\n,\nNissan\n,\nHonda\n,\nJaguar\n,\nFisker\n,\nHyundai\n,\nBMW\n,\nToyota\n,\nSubaru\n, and\nLucid Motors\nhave all committed to equipping their North American vehicles with NACS connectors in the future.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nAutomotive startup\nAptera Motors\nhas also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.\n[\n18\n]\nOther automakers, such as\nStellantis\nand\nVolkswagen\nhave not made an announcement.\n[\n19\n]\nTo meet\nEuropean Union\n(EU) requirements on recharging points,\n[\n20\n]\nTesla vehicles sold in the EU are equipped with a\nCCS Combo 2\nport. Both the North America and the EU port take 480\nV DC fast charging through Tesla's network of\nSuperchargers\n, which variously use NACS and CCS charging connectors. Depending on the Supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250 kW, the first corresponding to DC Level 1 and the second and third corresponding to DC Level 2 of SAE J1772. As of Q4 2021, Tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers (about 9 chargers per location on average).\n[\n4\n]\nFuture development\n[\nedit\n]\nAn extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles (\nClass 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well\n, including school and transit buses). When the\nCharging Interface Initiative e. V.\n(CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),\n[\n21\n]\nlater renamed\nMegawatt Charging System\n(MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200–1500\nV and 0–3000\nA for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5\nmegawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.\n[\n22\n]\nThe task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000\nV DC (optionally, 1500\nV DC) and 3000\nA continuous rating.\n[\n23\n]\nA connector design was selected in May 2019\n[\n21\n]\nand tested at the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n(NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.\n[\n24\n]\nThe final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n: 3\nWith support from\nPortland General Electric\n, on 21 April 2021\nDaimler Trucks North America\nopened the \"Electric Island\", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1\nMW chargers once they are available.\n[\n27\n]\nA startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California. At full capacity, it would provide a combined 25\nMW of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.\n[\n28\n]\nConnectors\n[\nedit\n]\nCommon charging connectors\nIEC\nType 4\n/\nCHAdeMO (left); CCS\nCombo 2\n(center); IEC\nType 2\noutlet (right)\nIEC\nType 1\n/\nSAE J1772\ninlet (left);\nNACS\n(center); IEC\nType 2 connector\noutlet (right)\nCommon connectors include\nType 1 (Yazaki)\n,\nType 2 (Mennekes)\n,\nCCS Combo 1 and 2\n,\nCHAdeMO\n, and Tesla.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nMany standard plug types are defined in\nIEC 62196\n-2 (for AC supplied power) and 62196-3 (for DC supplied power):\nType 1: single-phase AC vehicle coupler – SAE J1772/2009 automotive plug specifications\nType 2: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler –\nVDE-AR-E 2623-2-2\n,\nSAE J3068\n, and\nGB/T 20234.2\nplug specifications\nType 3: single- and three-phase AC vehicle coupler equipped with safety shutters –\nEV Plug Alliance\nproposal\nType 4: DC fast charge couplers\nConfiguration AA:\nCHAdeMO\nConfiguration BB:\nGB/T\n20234.3\nConfigurations CC/DD: (reserved)\nConfiguration EE:\nCCS\nCombo 1\nConfiguration FF:\nCCS\nCombo 2\nConnector designs listed in\nIEC 62196\n-2 and -3\n[\na\n]\nPower\nsupply\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nChina\n1-phase AC\n(62196.2)\nType 1 (\nSAE J1772\n)\nType 2\n[\nb\n]\n[\nc\n]\nType 1 (\nSAE J1772\n)\nType 2\n(\nGB/T 20234.2\n)\n[\nd\n]\n3-phase AC\n(62196.2)\nType 2\n(\nSAE J3068\n)\n—\nDC\n(62196.3)\nEE (\nCCS\nCombo 1)\nFF (\nCCS\nCombo 2)\n[\nc\n]\nAA (\nCHAdeMO\n)\n[\nc\n]\nBB (\nGB/T 20234.3\n)\n[\nb\n]\nChaoJi\n(planned)\nQuick Notes on EV Charger types\nNotes\n^\nFor pin definitions, see page for each specific standard\n^\na\nb\nIn India, \"low-power\" vehicles with traction battery voltages less than 100 V DC use the Bharat EV Charger standards. For AC charging (230 V, 15 A / 10 kW maximum), the Bharat EV Charger AC-001 standard endorses the\nIEC 60309\nthree-pin connector. For DC charging (48–72+ V, 200 A / 15 kW maximum), the corresponding Bharat EV Charger DC-001 standard endorses the same connector used in China (GB/T 20234.3).\n[\n33\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nFor high-power vehicles, India has largely adopted global standards: IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for AC charging (≥22 kW) and CHAdeMO and CCS Combo 2 for DC charging (≥50 kW).\n[\n32\n]\n^\nAlthough GB/T 20234.2 is physically capable of supporting three-phase power, the standard does not include its use.\nCCS DC charging requires\npower-line communication\n(PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.\nThe\nCHAdeMO\nstandard is favored by\nNissan\n,\nMitsubishi\n, and\nToyota\n, while the\nSAE J1772\nCombo standard is backed by\nGM\n,\nFord\n,\nVolkswagen\n,\nBMW\n, and\nHyundai\n. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:\nThe broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.\n[\n34\n]\nHistorical connectors\n[\nedit\n]\nPublic charging stations in a\nparking lot\nnear\nLos Angeles International Airport\n. Shown are two obsolete 6\nkW AC charging stations (left: inductive Magne-charge gen2 SPI (\"small paddle\"), right: conductive EVII ICS-200 AVCON).\nIn the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the\nGM EV1\n,\nFord Ranger EV\n, and\nChevrolet S-10 EV\npreferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector (\nMagne Charge\n) or a conductive connector (generally\nAVCON\n). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.\n[\n5\n]\n: 10–11\nMagne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation\nToyota RAV4 EV\n, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).\n[\n35\n]\nThe larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\n: 23\nSAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.\n[\n37\n]\n: 26\nThe influential\nCalifornia Air Resources Board\nadopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 June 2001, based on lower costs and durability,\n[\n38\n]\nand the Magne Charge paddle was discontinued by the following March.\n[\n39\n]\nThree conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: Avcon (aka butt-and-pin, used by Ford,\nSolectria\n, and Honda); Yazaki (aka pin-and-sleeve, on the RAV4 EV); and ODU (used by DaimlerChrysler).\n[\n37\n]\n: 22\nThe Avcon butt-and-pin connector supported Level 2 and Level 3 (DC) charging and was described in the appendix of the first version (1996) of the SAE J1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the United States.\n[\n37\n]\n: 25\n[\n40\n]\nIWC recommended the Avcon butt connector for North America,\n[\n37\n]\n: 22\nbased on environmental and durability testing.\n[\n41\n]\nAs implemented, the Avcon connector used four contacts for Level 2 (L1, L2, Pilot, Ground) and added five more (three for serial communications, and two for DC power) for Level 3 (L1, L2, Pilot, Com1, Com2, Ground, Clean Data ground, DC+, DC−).\n[\n42\n]\nBy 2009, J1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve (Yazaki) connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular Avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.\n[\n43\n]\nCharging time\n[\nedit\n]\nBYD e6\n. Able to recharge the battery in 15 minutes to 80%\nSolaris Urbino 12 electric\n,\nbattery electric bus\n, inductive charging station\nCharging time depends on the battery's capacity, power density, and charging power.\n[\n44\n]\nThe larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold (analogous to the size of a fuel tank). Higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time (the size of the tank opening). Higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time (analogous to a pump's flow rate). An important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the\nmains electricity\ngrid.\n[\n45\n]\nThe\nCalifornia Air Resources Board\nspecified a target minimum range of 150 miles (240 km) to qualify as a\nzero-emission vehicle\n, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.\n[\n46\n]\nCharge time can be calculated as:\n[\n47\n]\nCharging Time (h)\n=\nBattery capacity (kWh)\nCharging power (kW)\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{Charging Time (h)}}={\\frac {\\text{Battery capacity (kWh)}}{\\text{Charging power (kW)}}}}\nThe effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or\nbattery management system\n, charging losses (which can be as high as 25%\n[\n48\n]\n), and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a\ncharge controller\n.\nBattery capacity\n[\nedit\n]\nThe usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original Nissan Leaf, was about 20\nkilowatt-hours\n(kWh), giving it a range of about 100 mi (160 km).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nTesla\nwas the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their\nModel S\nwith battery capacities of 40\nkWh, 60\nkWh and 85\nkWh, with the latter lasting for about 480 km (300 mi).\n[\n49\n]\nAs of 2022\n[update]\nplug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15 to 60 miles (24–97 km).\n[\n50\n]\nAC to DC conversion\n[\nedit\n]\nBatteries are charged with DC power. To charge from the AC power supplied by the electrical grid, EVs have a small AC-to-DC converter built into the vehicle. The charging cable supplies AC power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to DC internally and charges its battery. The built-in converters on most EVs typically support charging speeds up to 6–7\nkW, sufficient for overnight charging.\n[\n51\n]\nThis is known as \"AC charging\". To facilitate rapid recharging of EVs, much higher power (50–100+\nkW) is necessary.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThis requires a much larger AC-to-DC converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. Instead, the AC-to-DC conversion is performed by the charging station, and DC power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. This is known as DC fast charging.\nCharging time for 100 km (62 miles) of range on a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range per\nEPA\n(111\nMPGe\n/ 188\nWh/km)\n[\n52\n]\nConfiguration\nVoltage\nCurrent\nPower\nCharging time\nComment\nSingle-phase\nAC\n120\nV\n12\nA\n1.44\nkW\n13\nhours\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a standard US/Canadian 120\nV 15\nA circuit\nSingle-phase AC\n230\nV\n16\nA\n3.68\nkW\n5.1\nhours\nThis is the maximum continuous power available from a\nCEE 7/3\n(\"Schuko\") receptacle on a 16\nA rated circuit\nSingle-phase AC\n240\nV\n30\nA\n7.20\nkW\n2.6\nhours\nCommon maximum limit of public AC charging stations used in North America, such as a ChargePoint CT4000\nThree-phase\nAC\n400\nV\n16\nA\n11.0\nkW\n1.7\nhours\nMaximum limit of a European 16\nA three-phase AC charging station\nThree-phase AC\n400\nV\n32\nA\n22.1\nkW\n51\nminutes\nMaximum limit of a European 32\nA three-phase AC charging station\nDC\n400\nV\n125\nA\n50\nkW\n22\nminutes\nTypical mid-power DC charging station\nDC\n400\nV\n300\nA\n120\nkW\n9\nminutes\nTypical power from a Tesla V2\nTesla Supercharger\nSafety\n[\nedit\n]\nA Sunwin electric bus in Shanghai at a charging station\nA\nbattery electric bus\ncharging station in\nGeneva\n, Switzerland\nCharging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the EV is not charging.\nThe two main types of safety sensors:\nCurrent sensors\nmonitor power consumed, and maintain the connection only while demand is within a predetermined range.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSensor wires provide a\nfeedback\nsignal such as specified by the\nSAE J1772\nand\nIEC 62196\nschemes that require special (multi-pin) power plug fittings.\nSensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCurrent sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.\nPublic charging stations over the world\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information on the coordinated development of charging stations in a region by a company or local government:\nelectric vehicle network\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nFebruary 2023\n)\nPublic charging station signs\nUS traffic sign\nPublic-domain international sign\nLonger drives require a network of public charging stations. In addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. Costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. Some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received (measured in kilowatt-hours). In the United States, some states have banned the use of charging by kWh.\n[\n53\n]\nCharging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.\n[\n54\n]\nThe stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous\nelectrical grid\n.\n[\n55\n]\nCharging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers.

Networks like\nElectrify America\n,\nEVgo\n, ChargeFinder and\nChargePoint\nare popular among consumers. Electrify America currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including\nAudi\n,\nBMW\n,\nFord\n,\nHyundai\n,\nKia\n,\nLucid Motors\n,\nMercedes\n,\nVolkswagen\n, and more. Prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card.\nIn June 2022, United States\nPresident Biden\nannounced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to EV brands, charging companies, or location, in the United States.\n[\n80\n]\nThe US will provide US$5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.\n[\n81\n]\nOne such proposed corridor called\nGreenlane\nplans to establish charging infrastructure between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.\n[\n82\n]\nHowever, by December 2023, no charging stations had been built.\n[\n83\n]\nAfrica\n[\nedit\n]\nBMW\nElectric Wireless car charger in\nJohannesburg\n, South Africa (2021)\nSouth African based\nElectroSA\nand automobile manufacturers including\nBMW\n,\nNissan\nand\nJaguar\nhave so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.\n[\n84\n]\nSouth America\n[\nedit\n]\nIn April 2017\nYPF\n, the state-owned oil company of\nArgentina\n, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.\n[\n85\n]\nProjects\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nElectric vehicle network\nElectric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide\nelectric vehicle networks\nof public charging stations.\nThe\nEV Plug Alliance\n[\n86\n]\nis an association of 21 European manufacturers that proposed an\nIEC\nnorm and a European standard for sockets and plugs. Members (\nSchneider Electric\n, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. Prior consensus was that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nHome chargers\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nNEMA connectors\nNEMA 14-50\n240 volt 50 amperes\nOver 80% of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.\n[\n90\n]\nIn North America, Level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120\nvolt\noutlet and provides less than 5 miles (8.0 km) of range per hour of charging.\nTo address the need for faster charging, Level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. These stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles (48 km) of range per hour. Level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for EV owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements.\nCharging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the\nmain electrical panel box\nor through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. A popular choice for the latter is the NEMA 14-50 receptacle. This type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to North American electrical code. This translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,\n[\n91\n]\noffering a faster and more efficient charging experience.\nBattery swap\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBattery swapping\nA battery swapping (or switching) station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. Battery swapping is common in electric\nforklift\napplications.\n[\n92\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. It was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by\nHartford Electric Light Company\n, through the GeVeCo battery service, serving electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by\nGeneral Electric\n.\n[\n93\n]\nThe power was purchased from Hartford Electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. These vehicles covered more than 6 million miles (9.7 million kilometres).\nBeginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars.\n[\n94\n]\n91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the\n2008 Summer Olympics\n.\n[\n95\n]\nBetter Place\n,\nTesla\n, and\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries\nconsidered battery switch approaches.\n[\n96\n]\n[\n97\n]\nOne complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications.\nIn 2012,\nTesla\nstarted building a proprietary fast-charging\nTesla Supercharger\nnetwork.\n[\n1\n]\nIn 2013, Tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.\n[\n98\n]\nA demonstration swapping station was built at\nHarris Ranch\nand operated for a short period of time. However customers vastly preferred using the Superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.\n[\n99\n]\nBenefits\n[\nedit\n]\nThe following benefits were claimed for battery swapping:\n\"Refueling\" in under five minutes.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n101\n]\nAutomation: The driver can stay in the car while the battery is swapped.\n[\n102\n]\nSwitch company subsidies could reduce prices without involving vehicle owners.\n[\n103\n]\nSpare batteries could participate in\nvehicle to grid\nenergy services.\n[\n104\n]\nProviders\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nNio\nbattery swap station at a carpark in Beijing\nThe\nBetter Place\nnetwork was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. The\nRenault Fluence Z.E.\nwas the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in Israel and Denmark.\n[\n105\n]\nBetter Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in\nKiryat Ekron\n, near\nRehovot\nin March 2011. The exchange process took five minutes.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n106\n]\nBetter Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013.\n[\n107\n]\n[\n108\n]\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced\nits plan to offer battery swapping\n. Tesla showed that a battery swap with the Model S took just over 90 seconds.\n[\n101\n]\n[\n109\n]\nElon Musk\nsaid the service would be offered at around\nUS$60\nto\nUS$80\nat June 2013 prices. The vehicle purchase included one battery pack. After a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. A second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receive/pay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. Pricing was not announced.\n[\n101\n]\nIn 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.\n[\n110\n]\nBy 2022, Chinese luxury carmaker\nNio\nhad built more than 900 battery swap stations across China and Europe,\n[\n111\n]\nup from 131 in 2020.\n[\n112\n]\nSites\n[\nedit\n]\nCar connected to an EV charger over a parking space\nUnlike\nfilling stations\n, which need to be located near roads that\ntank trucks\ncan enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to\nelectric power\nand adequate\nparking\n.\nPrivate locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.\n[\n113\n]\nResidences are by far the most common charging location.\n[\n114\n]\nResidential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.\n[\n115\n]\nMany vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.\n[\n116\n]\nThese cables may be wall mounted.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nPublic stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. Some gas stations offer EV charging stations.\n[\n117\n]\nSome charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing EV adoption.\n[\n118\n]\nPublic charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. Charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. The premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. Vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.\n[\n119\n]\nSites include malls,\nfreeway rest areas\n, transit stations, and government offices.\n[\n120\n]\n[\n121\n]\nTypically, AC\nType 1\n/\nType 2\nplugs are used.\nWireless charging\nstation\nDetail of a wireless inductive charging device\nWireless charging uses\ninductive charging\nmats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways.\nMobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator (typically gasoline or diesel), or a large battery.\nAn offshore electricity recharging system named Stillstrom, to be launched by Danish shipping firm\nMaersk Supply Service\n, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.\n[\n122\n]\nConnecting ships to electricity generated by\noffshore wind farms\n, Stillstrom is designed to cut\nemissions\nfrom idling ships.\n[\n122\n]\nRelated technologies\n[\nedit\n]\nSmart grid\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nsmart grid\nis a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. Some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. Some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.\n[\n123\n]\nVehicle-to-grid\nscenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. This requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. SAE International is developing related standards. These include SAE J2847/1.\n[\n124\n]\n[\n125\n]\nISO and IEC are developing similar standards known as\nISO/IEC 15118\n, which also provide protocols for automatic payment.\nRenewable energy\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSolar-charged vehicle\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nNovember 2023\n)\nElectric vehicles (EVs) can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. Renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.\n[\n126\n]\nCharging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. However, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. As of November 2023,\nElectrify America\nhas invested over $5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in rural California, including areas like Fresno County. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren't tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Electrify America’s Solar Glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in San Bernardino County, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.\n[\n127\n]\n[\n128\n]\nTesla's Superchargers and Destination Chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. Tesla's Superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. Some Destination Chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. As of 2023, Tesla's global network was 100% renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching.\nSeveral\nChevrolet Volts\nat a charging station partially powered with\nsolar panels\nin\nFrankfort, Illinois\n(2012)\nThe E-Move Charging Station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76\nkW of solar power.\n[\n129\n]\nIn 2012,\nUrban Green Energy\nintroduced the world's first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump.

Residential outlets can be part of a circuit used to power multiple lights and other electrical devices, and could become overloaded if used to charge a PEV. A dedicated circuit for PEV charging may need to be installed by a licensed electrician in these situations. Also, some commercial parking lot outlets operate in a load restricted or cycled manner and using them may result in your PEV receiving a lower charge than expected or no charge at all.

      "text": "The Electric Vehicle Evolution\nBy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Susser\nFebruary 2, 2017\nShare\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are a growing market for new car purchases as more and more drivers make the switch from the gas station to an outlet to power their vehicles. EVs come in two forms: They use electricity as their sole source of power (battery-electric vehicles) or electricity along with a conventional engine for backup (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles).\nPeople are going electric for\nall kinds of reasons\n. Many are motivated by the savings, as drivers typically save hundreds of dollars a year in gasoline and spend substantially less on maintenance. Then there are the environmental benefits thanks to reduced emissions, high quality driving performance and energy independence using locally generated electricity.\nThe recent influx of EVs has brought with it a need for charging infrastructure. Businesses, governments and utilities have been installing charging stations across the country, and according to the\nU.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center\n, there are tens of thousands of locations currently available.\nThe move toward EVs is expected to continue, especially with the investments and commitments from major auto manufacturers — nearly every manufacturer is developing or selling an EV. But how and why did this all get started? Let’s step back and take a look at the history of electric transportation.\nEarly Success\nEVs actually have their origin in the 1800s. The first American electric car was developed by William Morrison in 1891. His six-passenger wagon reached a top speed of 14 mph. (While this may seem slow, in 1899 the land speed record was set by an EV at 66 mph.) Morrison’s invention was considered the first practical example of an EV, and it spurred interest in electric transportation.\nSource:\nElectric Vehicle News\nThe end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century saw great progress for EVs. They made up close to 40% of the U.S. market at one point, and electric taxi fleets were transporting passengers in both New York City and London. The vehicles were known for their smooth, quiet rides, unlike their steam or gasoline counterparts, and they were easy to drive and maneuver. Early gasoline cars required a hand-crank to switch gears, which was a hassle and potentially dangerous. EVs quickly became the transportation method of choice, particularly for short trips around the city.\nHybrid versions also appeared at this time. For example, Woods Motor Vehicle Company produced the Dual Power with both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. For speeds below 15 mph, the electric motor was used, and beyond that (and up to 35 mph), the conventional engine took over. In addition, General Electric designed a gasoline-electric hybrid bus for use in New York City.\nThe First Charging Stations\nSo how did these EVs charge? At least one public charging station existed during the early days of electric transportation. At the beginning of the 20th century, General Electric produced the “Electrant,” which offered street charging in New York City. EVs could also be charged at a dealer’s charging location, and batteries could be removed and charged separately.\nWith more and more city homes being wired for electricity, home charging was developed as well, and personal charging equipment could be used for both DC and AC service. However, the process was more involved and the setup more unwieldy than what we are used to today.\nSource:\nElectric Vehicle Association of Greater Washington, DC\nBump in the Road\nDespite the early popularity of EVs, they began to disappear from the streets after just a few years. A number of events triggered this decline. For one, roadways improved beyond city limits, and people wanted to get out and explore. With their slower speeds and shorter ranges, EVs were not ideal for this type of travel.\nAt the same time, gasoline cars began to improve. In 1912, Charles Kettering designed the electric starter, which eliminated the need to manually hand crank vehicles and provided safer and more efficient travel. Furthermore, technology enhanced the internal combustion engine, and Henry Ford pioneered the accessible and affordable Model T. Declining gas prices made gas-powered vehicles even more appealing, while electric models continued to be costly. Indeed, they could be two-to-three times more expensive than gasoline cars. By 1930, EVs had basically vanished from roads.\nBack on Track\nInterest in EVs made a bit of a resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s, but it wasn’t until the early 1990s that a more substantial push for driving electric was realized. This surge was mainly driven by regulations and legislation, such as the California Air Resources Board, which pushed for more fuel-efficient and emissions-free vehicles. In 1996, General Motors (GM) developed the first mass-produced battery-electric car, the EV1. The EV1 had a range of approximately 60 miles and a top speed of 80 mph. By 2002, though, GM discontinued it. The California Air Resources Board mandate had been weakened, and GM viewed electric transportation as an unprofitable sector of the market. Other EVs of the time saw similar fates.\nApproximately half a decade after the EV1’s discontinuation, GM was looking to reenter the market along with other auto manufacturers, such as Nissan. Elon Musk and Tesla (which was founded in 2003) were in the midst of producing their Roadster, a battery-electric sports car that could travel 200 miles on a single charge. The focus now centered on producing mass-market and affordable electric transportation. GM began working on the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with both a battery and small gasoline engine; and Nissan was gearing up for the LEAF, its battery-electric car. With continued competition and improving technology, EVs seemed back on track.\nPlugging In\nThe renewed interest in EVs triggered a need for charging infrastructure. In a way, history was repeating itself: In the early 20th century, during the first dip in electric transportation and rise of gas-powered cars, gas stations were scarce. Drivers needed to memorize their locations when planning a trip, before they started popping up more frequently in the 1930s. Likewise, just two decades ago, EV charging stations were virtually nonexistent, but they are quickly becoming more and more numerous.\nToday, just like a century ago, people primarily charge their vehicles at home, but there are also thousands of public charging locations across the U.S. Charging comes in three levels: Level 1, Level 2 and DC fast charge. Level 1, which uses a standard 120-volt outlet, provides about 3 to 5 miles per hour of charging, Level 2 can supply 10 to 60 miles per hour of charging, and DC fast chargers provide 60 to 80 miles in 20 minutes. Tesla has developed its own line of DC fast chargers, known as Superchargers, which can add between 5 and 15 miles of range per minute of charging. Level 1 and Level 2 charging are common in homes, workplaces and public locations where people might visit for longer periods. DC fast charging is more suited for supporting long-distance travel and is typically found along heavily trafficked corridors.\nCharging and the Grid\nAs the industry progresses, opportunities are arising to integrate charging with the electric grid to support its operation. For example, researchers are evaluating\nvehicle-to-grid technology\n, which allows a parked vehicle to return electricity back to the grid and can improve functionality. A similar system exists for the home, where energy stored in a vehicle’s battery can help alleviate consumption of power during peak periods when demand is high, or serve as backup during an outage. In addition, many charging station owners have installed solar arrays to charge vehicles or offset the electricity used for charging, producing a truly emissions-free experience.\nSource:\nEarthshine Nature Programs\nThe Future is Electric\nWith the foundation laid for EVs and their infrastructure, driving electric is becoming the new norm. The concerns of the past – speed, driving distance and charging time – are quickly diminishing. New models consistently go 200+ miles on a charge, and upfront prices continue to decrease thanks to improvements in technology, and they are approaching parity with gasoline models. Electric transportation is also branching out beyond light-duty vehicles into other classes, with medium- and\nheavy-duty EVs\nquickly arriving.\nThese developments, coupled with the spread and progress of charging stations, paint an optimistic picture. Increased education about the benefits and specifics of these vehicles will be needed, but soon enough, we will have a new heyday of electric transportation.\nTo learn more about driving electric in North Carolina, check out\nPlug-in NC\n, our statewide collaborative program that promotes EVs through education and outreach, consulting and resource development.\nIs your organization interested in installing electric vehicle charging stations?\nSee how Advanced Energy can help.\nAll Blog Posts\nPrevious\nNext",

With lower operational costs and reduced dependency on changing fuel prices, electric mobility is the way to go.\nAs Indians acknowledge these advantages, EV sales continue to soar high in the country. According to areport by CareEdge, the sales of E2W (Electric Two-Wheelers) grew by 188% in FY23 compared to the previous year FY22. With this quick adoption of electric vehicles, the topic of installing EV charger for home is also on the rise. While the charging infrastructure is rapidly growing in India, they are not always convenient, especially when you are in a hurry and want to skip the queue. This is when home chargers for EVs come into play.\nIn today’s blog, we will discuss the benefits of installing the best home EV chargers and what factors to consider.\nWhile EV sales continue to skyrocket, people are still adapting to the new experience of owning and charging an electric vehicle. With the option to choose from a myriad of different home charging station setups, it can get confusing. But before choosing a home charger for EVs, you must consider several factors.\nLet’s discuss some of the most important things to consider before looking at the different types of EV charger for home.\nThe first factor that plays an important role in deciding on a home charger for EVs is usability. Making the switch from an ICE to an EV is a big jump, and most owners are daunted by the overwhelming feeling of charging an EV. This is why it is necessary to have the best EV home charger – to smoothly transition from owning a traditional vehicle to an electric one.\nTo make usability convenient for EV owners, there are plenty of EV charger for homes that come along with LED light indications meant to show different charging statuses.\nApart from the ease of use, the second factor that plays an important role in installing EV chargers for homes is the charging speed. There are two maintypes of EV charging speeds– AC Charging and DC Charging. Level 1 and Level 2 charging come under AC charging, while DC charging is fast charging containing Level 3 and others.\nDepending on the charging speed your EV supports, you will need to install a compatible type of EV charger for your home.\nAllocating a budget of around₹2,671 crore under the FAME(Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) scheme for the financial year 2024-25, the Indian government is pushing the promotion of sustainable mobility. This approach subsidizes the installation of EV home charging stations. Hence, you should look out for rebates for home EV chargers before buying home chargers.\nApart from the incentives and technical aspects, it’s important to acknowledge the practicality of installing a home charging station.\nYou need to consider the parking space to understand where you want to install the charging station. Do you park in an open space? Or do you have a basement space for parking your electric vehicle? This is important to consider as not all home chargers are weather-proof. Some might not be able to handle the heat or rain if the home EV charger is meant to be used in a basement space. Further, if the home charging station is weather-proof, its resistance level also varies.\nWhether you use your electric vehicle for your daily commute or once in a while for a weekend getaway, you should consider your lifestyle before installing the correct type of EV chargers for your home. This is because if you live a nomadic life, it will make more sense to have a portable charging setup rather than installing a wall-mounted one. Hence, consider your lifestyle before choosing the best home EV charger.\nNow that you have considered all the factors before installing a home charging station well-suited for your EV needs, it’s time to look at the benefits of installing EV chargers for your home.\nInstalling a charging station at home and plugging your EV in it for charging is like charging your phone overnight. Most EV owners find it convenient to keep their vehicle in charge overnight and ready to use the next day. Assuming you would not need the vehicle all night, it only makes sense to charge it at your home charging station while sleeping and take advantage of the overnight charge the next day.\nHence, one of the biggest benefits of installing home chargers for your EV is eliminating the additional time required to travel to the nearest public EV charging station and the hours you wait to complete a charging cycle.\nYou can save some bucks by installing home chargers for EVs compared to using a public charging station for every charge. Like other businesses, public charging stations charge you an overhead fee that may include rent, maintenance, and other miscellaneous charging station costs. Further, even though you use the free charging stations available at restaurants or malls, you end up spending your money inside the facilities.\nWith an EV charging station at home, charging your EV becomes cheaper as installation will be a one-time cost, and you may even benefit from tax exemption. Furthermore, you can use solar charging stations to reduce your costs.\nPredictability is another reason why you should be installing home chargers for EVs. One of the biggest downsides of charging your EVs in a public charge station is unpredictability in terms of waiting. Sometimes, you may not have to wait in a long queue of vehicles, while other times, you may not find yourself lucky enough.\nWith an EV home charger, you avoid falling into the hands of unpredictability as you know exactly how many hours it is going to take to charge your vehicle; depending on this, you can schedule your day. If you want to skip the daytime charging hassle, you can even leave your EV on slow charging overnight.\nIn order for an EV to be charged in a controlled and safe manner, every charger has a charge controller. It manages the current sent to the EV from the charger while also ensuring the vehicle is not overcharged, saving its battery life.\nEvery best home EV charger has a charge controller for this, and Bacancy is India’s leading EV charge controller manufacturer.

As reported in March 2023 byStatista, there are more than 2.3 million EVs in the country, among which two and three-wheeler vehicles make up about 1.1 million of the population. By 2035, the automobile industry may become fully electric.\nAs the number of first-time EV owners grows, the awareness of maintaining the vehicle and optimizing its health has increased. One such trend in electric mobility is seen in how people have changed the way they charge their EV batteries.\nUnlike traditional fuel-based vehicles, electric vehicles are more diverse. They use charging stations for recharging the batteries, and their charging time depends on the type of charging station you plug them into. A charging station is a facility that supplies electric energy to recharge the battery of an electric vehicle. There are three main types of charging stations – Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast, Charging station.\nThis article is a deep dive into the different levels of EV charging speeds and how various factors affect the time it takes for your EV to charge.\nThe charging speed of an EV refers to the rate at which the battery is recharged. Typically measured in kilowatts (kW) and megawatts (MW), several factors influence the charging speed and the time it takes for your EV to charge, including the vehicle’s voltage and current constraints, battery degeneration, the battery’s state of charge, temperature, and other loads while charging.\nWhen charging your EV, you may encounter variations in charging speed compared to the manufacturer’s specifications. This is influenced by various factors, including:\nState of Charge (SoC) refers to the initial battery level when initiating the charging process for your electric vehicle (EV). Within the 20% to 80% range, we find optimal charging efficiency, as slower charging rates are typically observed below 20% or above 80%. This specific range allows the battery to handle peak loads and ensures an optimal charging experience.\nAs a general rule of thumb for your EV, the battery needs to be at the perfect temperature to start the charging process to protect its health. The Battery Management System (BMS) in your EV takes care of this process. It restricts the battery from getting extremely hot and cold when on charge and hence regulates the charging speed for a longer-lasting battery lifespan.\nWhile it takes time for the battery to deteriorate and lose its charging capacity, every vehicle is different, and the battery degenerates depending on its chemistry and other factors. The possibility of battery degeneration in an EV increases with time. This degradation is a natural and expected process that occurs as a result of various factors, such as charge-discharge cycles, temperature variations, and overall age, and it also affects the charging speed of your EV.\nThe charging speed of an EV also depends on the voltage and current limits, as they are different for each electric vehicle, depending on the model and make. The power your EV will receive in a charge is measured in kilowatts (kW), which consists of voltage and current. The EV charger, as well as your EV, has current and voltage limits. So, when you plug in the charger, it will deliver current by matching the battery’s voltage.\nTo make sure you have the maximum charging speed for your vehicle, look for a charging station that will match the voltage and current limits of your vehicle.\nApart from the above factors, other loads may also impact the charging speed of your vehicle. For example, charging your electric vehicle (EV) alongside other electrical demands like air conditioning or headlights could result in a reduction in charging speed. This is attributed to the electrical load produced by these accessories, which may compete with the charging process and potentially lead to a slowdown.\nCharging of an EV can be classified into three levels – Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 – where the higher the level, the faster your EV will charge. These levels usually come under two types of electrical currents: AC Charging and DC Charging.\nAlternating Current (AC) charging changes the flow of its current periodically, which is where it gets its name from. It is supplied through electrical grids, which makes it easy to set up an EV charging Station with fewer infrastructure modifications, making it accessible for everyone.\n(a) Level 1 Charging\nLevel 1, AC charging is the slowest but the most accessible way of charging your electric vehicle. The process of charging your EV at Level 1 involves plugging it into a standard household electrical outlet with the electrical cable provided to you by the EV manufacturer.\nThe charging speed of Level 1 AC charging is slower compared to higher-level charging options like Level 2 and Level 3 (DC fast charging). It’s commonly used for overnight charging at home, making it suitable for scenarios where you don’t need a quick charge, such as when you have several hours or overnight.\nLevel 1 charging can be used anywhere, but the power output is limited to give you a range of charging between 1 kW and 1.8 kW through a standard 120 Volt AC charging outlet.\n(b) Level 2 Charging\nLevel 2 AC charging charges the EV at a capacity higher than Level 1 AC charging. It is one of the common charging options for electric vehicles and is faster than Level 1 charging. This level requires a dedicated charging station, which you can place in residential areas, public parking spaces, or workplaces.\nThe time required to charge an electric vehicle fully with a Level 2 charger can vary significantly based on the vehicle’s battery capacity and the charger’s power output. As a general guideline, Level 2 charging can add around 16-96 km of range per hour, depending on the specific vehicle. Charging an EV at Level 2 charging can be about 5 to 15 times faster than charging at Level 1.\nDirect Current (DC) charging, also referred to as fast charging, is level 3 of EV charging. It uses direct current to charge an EV. With the ability to deliver 30 kW to 400 kW power, DC fast charging is a common way of EV charging for commercial charging spaces. The DC charging stations transform AC power sourced from the grid into DC power, allowing the EV to channel DC current directly into the battery when plugged in.\nTypically, depending on the charging station output and the vehicle, most EVs can take between 15 minutes to an hour to get charged at Level 3, DC charging station. Since DC chargers supply electricity to the EV’s battery in the form of direct current, as opposed to AC used in Level 1 and Level 2 charging, it allows for faster charging because it bypasses the need for the vehicle’s onboard charger to convert the AC to DC.\nDC charging stations come in various power levels, typically ranging from 20 kW to 350 kW or even higher for ultra-fast chargers. The charging power significantly influences the charging speed. Higher power chargers can charge an EV more quickly.\nThere are two major categories of DC Fast Charging designed to provide different levels of power and charging speeds. They include:\n(a) High Capacity Charging\nHigh-capacity charging refers to fast-charging solutions that provide relatively high power levels compared to standard DC fast chargers. It can deliver power levels exceeding 100 kW. These charging stations are designed to deliver a significantly higher rate of energy transfer to the EV, which leads to reduced charging times.\nThis type of DC fast charging is used for EVs with larger battery capacity, like long-range electric cars, electric buses, and commercial electric trucks. It’s commonly deployed along major highways and in urban areas where vehicles need to charge quickly to minimize downtime. One of the prime advantages of high-capacity charging is reduced charging time, making it more convenient for EV users, especially for commercial and public transit vehicles that operate on tight schedules.\n(b) Megawatt Charging\nMegawatt charging refers to a high-power electric vehicle (EV) charging system capable of delivering charging rates in the megawatt range, typically defined as charging rates of 1 megawatt (MW) or more. This is in contrast to the more common kilowatt (kW) charging stations used for most consumer EVs.\nThe primary purpose of megawatt charging is to rapidly charge electric vehicles, particularly electric buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty vehicles, as well as high-capacity passenger EVs like those used in ride-sharing or taxi services. Some of the most useful applications of megawatt charging are as follows:\n\nElectric buses and trucks used for public transportation and delivery services can benefit from megawatt charging to minimize downtime and increase operational efficiency.\n\nLarge electric vehicles, such as long-haul trucks, construction equipment, and industrial machinery, often require megawatt charging to ensure they can recharge quickly and continue their work.\n\nIn settings like airport shuttle services, taxi companies, or ride-sharing platforms, where vehicles are in near-constant operation, rapid charging is important to maximize their availability.\nAC charging at lower power levels (Level 1) is gentler on the battery and may have a minimal impact on battery life. Level 2 AC charging is generally a daily charging preference because of its availability, but frequent use of high-power AC chargers may increase wear on the battery over time.\nOn the other hand, frequent DC fast charging can create more stress and heat on the battery compared to AC charging. While modern EVs are designed to handle fast charging, regular use of high-power DC chargers, especially those with extremely high power levels, can lead to faster battery degradation. It’s essential to note that EV manufacturers implement various strategies to mitigate these effects, such as battery cooling systems and thermal management.\nChoosing the right charging speed for your EV is crucial as it impacts its efficiency and longevity and shapes your EV-owning experience. Since every EV is different and comes with varying charging capabilities, it’s essential to select the correct charging speed to ensure you don’t underutilize or overwhelm the vehicle’s charging capability. Further, charging with the right level of speed  can be achieved byBacancy’s CCS2 Controller. The speed is also necessary to maintain the battery’s health in the long run, saving your money on expensive battery replacements.\nGet in Touch with our Technical Experts\n\nMarch 6, 2025\nBy :                                              Dhwani Valecha\nThe Indian EV sector is providing end customers and businesses with the opportunity to reduce environmental effects.

If certifications are not provided, the fields on compliance are manufacturer-reported.\nCharging Infrastructure Terminology\nThe charging infrastructure industry has aligned with a common standard called the\nOpen Charge Point Interface\n(OCPI) protocol, which uses specific terminology to describe charging infrastructure: station location, EV charging port, and connector. The Alternative Fuels Data Center and the\nStation Locator\nuse the following charging infrastructure definitions:\nStation Location:\nA station location represents a physical place with one or more EV charging ports. Examples include a parking garage or a parking lot. In some cases like a large mall parking lot, there may be multiple station locations even if they have the same address.\nEV Charging Port (also called a charger):\nAn EV charging port provides power to charge only one vehicle at a time even though it may have multiple connectors. The unit that houses EV charging ports is sometimes called a charging post, which can have one or more EV charging ports. EV charging ports are also sometimes referred to as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) ports.\nConnector:\nA connector is what is plugged into a vehicle to charge it. Multiple connectors and connector types (such as CHAdeMO and CCS) can be available on one EV charging port, but only one vehicle will charge at a time. Connectors are sometimes called plugs.\nTo better understand terminology for networked stations and how data is collected and displayed in the\nAlternative Fueling Station Locator\n, see\nElectric Vehicle Charging Networks\n.\nCharging Equipment\nCharging equipment for EVs is classified by the rate at which the batteries are charged. Charging times vary based on how depleted the battery is (i.e., state-of-charge), how much energy it holds (i.e., capacity), the type of battery, the vehicle's internal charger capacity, and the type of charging equipment (e.g., charging level, charger power output, and electrical service specifications). The charging time can range from less than 20 minutes using DC fast chargers to 20 hours or more using Level 1 chargers, depending on these and other factors. When\nchoosing equipment\nfor a specific application, many factors, such as networking, payment capabilities, and\noperation and maintenance\n, should be considered.\nAC Level 1 Charging\nApproximately 5 miles of range per 1 hour of charging\n*\nJ1772 connector\nAlternating Current (AC)\nLevel 1 equipment (often referred to simply as Level 1) provides charging through a 120 volt (V) AC plug. Most EVs will come with a portable Level 1 cordset, so no additional charging equipment is required. On one end of the cord is a standard\nNEMA\nconnector (for example, a NEMA 5-15, which is a common three-prong household plug), and on the other end is an SAE J1772 standard connector (often referred to simply as J1772, shown in the above image). The J1772 connector plugs into the car's J1772 charge port, and the NEMA connector plugs into a standard\nNEMA\nwall outlet.\nLevel 1 charging is typically used when there is only a 120 V outlet available, such as while charging at home, but it can easily provide charging for most drivers' needs. For example, 8 hours of charging at 120 V can replenish about 40 miles of electric range for a mid-size EV. As of 2023,\nless than 1% of public EV charging ports in the United States were Level 1\n.\n*\nAssumes 1.9 kW charging power\nAC Level 2 Charging\nApproximately 25 miles of range per 1 hour of charging\n†\nJ1772 connector\nJ3400 (NACS) connector\nAC Level 2 equipment (often referred to simply as Level 2) offers charging through 240 V (typical in residential applications) or 208 V (typical in commercial applications) electrical service. Most homes have 240 V service available, and because Level 2 equipment can charge a typical EV battery overnight, EV owners commonly install it for\nhome charging\n. Level 2 equipment is also commonly used for\npublic and workplace charging\nand can operate at 40 to 80 amperes (Amp). Most residential Level 2 chargers operate at up to 30 Amps, delivering 7.2 kW of power. These units require a dedicated 40-Amp circuit to comply with the National Electric Code requirements in Article 625. As of 2023,\nnearly 80% of public EV charging ports in the United States were Level 2\n.\nLevel 2 charging equipment uses the same J1772 connector that Level 1 equipment uses. All commercially available EVs in the United States have the ability to charge using Level 1 and Level 2 charging equipment.\nVehicles with a J3400 connector (currently only Tesla vehicles) can use the connector for all charging levels, including Tesla's Level 2 Destination Chargers and chargers for home. All Tesla vehicles come with a J1772 adapter, which allows them to use non-Tesla Level 2 charging equipment.\n†\nA Level 2 unit can range from 2.9 to 19.2 kW power output.\nDC Fast Charging\nApproximately 100 to 200+ miles of range per 30 minutes of charging\n‡\nCCS connector\nCHAdeMO connector\nJ3400 (NACS) connector\nDirect-current (DC)\nfast charging equipment (typically a three-phase AC input) enables rapid charging along heavy traffic corridors at installed stations at power outputs up to 500 kW. This is also referred to as Level 3 charging. As of 2023,\nmore than 20% of public EV charging ports in the United States were DC fast chargers\n. The availability of DC fast charging is expected to increase as a result of federal funding to build a national EV charging network, such as the\nNational Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program\n, the national\nAlternative Fuel Corridors grant program\n, and the\nCharging and Fueling Infrastructure Grants\n. Additionally, DC fast charging is projected to increase due to fleets adopting medium- and heavy-duty EVs (e.g., commercial trucks and vans and transit), as well as the installation of fast charging hubs for transportation network companies (e.g., Uber and Lyft) and other applications.\nThere are three types of DC fast charging systems, depending on the type of charge port on the vehicle: SAE Combined Charging System (CCS), CHAdeMO, and J3400.\nThe\nCCS\nconnector (also known as SAE J1772 combo) lets drivers use the same charge port with AC Level 1, Level 2, and DC fast charging equipment. The only difference is that the DC fast charging connector has two additional bottom pins. Most EV models on the market can charge using the CCS connector.\nThe\nCHAdeMO\nconnector is another common DC fast connector type among Japanese automakers.\nSAE International is standardizing the\nJ3400\nconnector based on Tesla’s design for the NACS connector, which works for all charging levels, including Tesla's fast charging option, called a Supercharger. Although Tesla vehicles do not have a CCS or CHAdeMO charge port, they come with a limited CCS or CHAdeMO adapter that supports charging up to 19.2 kW. Tesla does sell full power adapters for both connector types. Several vehicle manufacturers have announced\nadopting the J3400 connector\nas early as 2025, which will allow non-Tesla EVs to charge at Tesla stations with the J3400 connector.\n‡\nA DC charging unit can provide up to 500 kW. Charging power varies by vehicle and battery state of charge.\nCharging Infrastructure Procurement and Installation\nIncreasing available public and private charging equipment requires infrastructure procurement. Learn about how to successfully plan for, procure, and install charging infrastructure.\nCharging Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance\nOnce charging infrastructure has been procured and installed, it must be properly operated and maintained. Learn about charging infrastructure operation and maintenance considerations.\nAdditional Charging Options\nAnother standard (\nSAE J3068\n) was developed in 2018 for higher rates of AC charging using three-phase power, which is common at commercial and industrial locations in the United States. Some components of the standard were adapted from the European three-phase charging standards and specified for North American AC grid voltages and requirements. In the United States, the common three-phase voltages are typically 208/120 V, 480/277 V. The standard targets power levels between 6 kW and 130 kW.\nThe Megawatt Charging System (MCS) is under development for DC charging up to 3.75 MW for short-dwell as well as lower power (<500 kW) long-dwell overnight charging for medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications. A\n2022 report\nlooks at the requirements for charging stations that could support in-route charging for heavy-duty EVs.\n\nWhile 500 kW chargers are currently available from several charging manufacturers, the U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office is pursuing research that will bridge the technology gaps associated with implementing these networks in the United States. A 2017\nreport\nhighlights technology gaps at the battery, vehicle, and infrastructure levels. In particular, many EVs on the roads today are not capable of charging at rates higher than 200 kW. However, vehicle technology is advancing, and most new EV models will be able to charge at higher rates, enabling the use of faster charging. You can find additional resources on EV charging and\nadvanced charging system research efforts\nfrom the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n. For answers to frequently asked questions about the MCS and SAE J3271, see the fact sheet on\nCharging for Heavy-Duty Electric Trucks\nfrom Argonne National Laboratory.\nInductive Charging\nInductive charging equipment, which uses an electromagnetic field to transfer electricity to an EV without a cord, has been introduced commercially for installation as an aftermarket add-on. Some currently available wireless charging stations operate at power levels comparable to Level 2, though this technology is more common for transit or\nother fleet operations\nat higher power levels comparable to DC fast. The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting research to investigate the feasibility of high-powered wireless charging. More information on\ninductive charging research efforts\nis available from the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n.",

Introduction \nElectric vehicle (EV) charging stations are commonly \nfound at stores, ofce buildings, and all types of \nparking facilities. This guide is for commercial site \nowners considering installation of an EV charging \nstation. It addresses topics such as determining if a \nlocation is a good ft for an EV charging station, which \ntype of charging station to purchase, where to place \nit in the parking lot, who can install it, and how to \nmanage its operations. This document incorporates \nbest practices and lessons learned from EV charging \nstations that have been installed through the New York \nState Energy Research and Development Authority’s \n(NYSERDA) program for deploying EV charging \nstations. \n2. What are the criteria \nfor a cost-efective \nEV charging station? \nFor a cost-efective and successful charging station \ninstallation, site owners should consider how much \nuse they can expect and how much beneft EV drivers \ncan get from charging while parked at that location. \nOfering charging can help increase visits; keep \ncustomers for longer durations; serve as a good perk \nfor tenants, employees, or residents; and generate \nrevenue through charging fees and advertising. The \nbest way to ensure that your charging station is used \nis to know that a resident, employee, or regular client \nowns an EV and wants to charge it at your location. This \ninterest is easier to predict for workplaces or multifamily \nbuildings, but EV drivers often seek out charging \nlocations as they go about their everyday routines at, \nfor example, restaurants, stores, and entertainment \nvenues. The New York State EV Registration Map (see \nFigure 1) can give you a sense of how many EV drivers \nlive near you. \nOther considerations weigh into whether your site \nmay be a good place to install a charging station. \nConsider the time an EV driver would typically spend \nparked at that location. Level 2 stations, the most \ncommonly installed stations, provide between 10 \nand 20 miles of range for every hour of charging, so \nshort stays don’t ofer as much of a charging beneft \nto EV drivers. If you lease your building or have a \n1 \nFigure 1  Number of plug-in electric vehicles in New York State as of January 1, 2015, by county \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2  Many Kohl’s department stores across the New York State ofer free electric vehicle charging to customers \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nthird-party operated parking facility, you should work \nout arrangements to clarify ownership, operation, \nand revenue in advance. Additional important factors \ninclude, but are not limited to: \n• Patterns of travel in an area; an area’s\ndemographics, which may be correlated with\ncharacteristics typical of EV owners\n• The nature of a potential charging station\nlocation, whether it is public parking lots or\ngarages, retail locations, leisure destinations,\nmultifamily housing, hotels, transit centers, or\nother institutions.\nSelect examples of charging station locations across \nNew York State are shown in Figure2 and 3. For more \nin-depth information on factors that make a good EV \ncharging location read the Charging Station Cluster \nAnalysis (nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Files/Programs/ \nChargeNY/EVSE-Cluster-Analysis.pdf). \n3. What level of EV\ncharging station should\nbe installed?\nThe charging requirements at each location determine \nthe type of charging station that should be installed. \nAs illustrated on page 4 by Figure 4, most EV drivers \nwill charge their vehicles at home the majority of the \ntime. However, EV drivers also seek public charging \ninfrastructure to use at work, around town, and on \nlonger trips. Many of these chargers come with an \noption to purchase a subscription to a charging \nnetwork that can collect payments from users and \nlimits use of the station to charging network members. \nThere is often no fee for EV drivers to become a \nmember, and there is also an option to activate the \nstation using a toll-free number for anyone that does \n2 \n\n \n  \n \n \nFigure 3  Examples of EV charging station locations \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nHomewood-Suites, Colonie \nVent Fitness, Albany \nUniversity at Bufalo \nAlbany Airport \nWindham Mountain Ski Resort \nnot have a network card. \nIn addition to listing the station on its network maps for \nEV drivers, the network (for a subscription fee around \n$20 to $30 per month per charging outlet) will track \nstation usage and enable the owner to bill for use. \nThe most common station ownership model is for \nthe host site to own the station. However, third-party \ncharging station service providers ofer a diferent \nbusiness model, in which they pay for the installation, \noperate the station, and share some of the profts with \nthe host site. Some charging station manufacturers, \nthird-party charging station service providers, and \ncharging station network providers ofer a lease option \nas well. \nLevel 2 charging stations are a popular choice for \ncommercial installations because they typically ofer \nbetter durability and more features, such as a cord \nmanagement system that keeps the cord of the \nground when not in use (Figure 5 on next page) and \nnetwork connections for tracking use, establishing \npayments, or making reservations. Most manufacturers \nofer charging stations that can be wall-mounted or \ninstalled as a stand-alone pedestal. They often have \nmodels with either a single or double charging port \nper station. Level 2 charging stations provide 10 to 20 \nmiles of range per hour of charging, a sufcient boost \nfor EV drivers parked for a few hours. The equipment \ncosts between $2,000 and $10,000, with more \nfeatures available at the higher end of this range. \n3 \n\n \n \nFigure 4  Most EV charging happens at home using \nslower chargers, while public chargers are used less \nfrequently but provide faster charges \nFigure 5  An EV charging station with cord management | \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nIn multifamily homes and workplaces (or longer term \nparking at airports and other transit hubs), EV drivers \npark for an extended period of time and may not \nrequire Level 2 charging. This is especially true for \ndrivers of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that have \nsmaller battery packs or battery electric vehicle drivers \nthat regularly charge at another location and don’t \nrequire a full charge each time they park at these \nlocations. \nTo reduce the costs for the stations and their \ninstallation, Level 1 stations, which provide two to fve \nmiles of range per hour of charging time, might be a \nbetter option. With the same electrical service and \npanel, two Level 1 stations can be installed instead of \none Level 2 station and cost a lot less. (Level 1 electric \nvehicle supply equipment [EVSE] is less than $1,000). \nMany EVs come with portable Level 1 EVSE that can \nbe used as long as the parking lot provides a 120-volt \noutlet on a dedicated circuit for it to be plugged in. The \npower draw by Level 1 stations is much less, so there is \nless electrical expense to the host. However, because \nof their simplicity, most Level 1 stations do not have the \noption for a subscription on a charging network and \ncannot easily bill EV drivers for usage. \n4. What installation factors \nshould be considered? \nA number of factors infuence charging station \ninstallation costs, which can often exceed the cost \nof the hardware itself. These factors should be \nconsidered when determining site viability and the \nideal location to install the charging station on the \nproperty. The largest factor is usually the currently \navailable electrical service. All new charging station \ninstallations should have a load analysis performed on \nthe facility’s electrical demand to determine if there is \ncapacity to add EV charging stations. \nLevel 2 stations will need a dedicated 240-volt \n(40 amp) circuit. Upgrading electrical service, if \nneeded, adds signifcant cost to the installation. A \nlonger distance between the electrical panel and \nthe EV charging station means increased installation \ncosts because it increases the amount of necessary \ntrenching (and repair), conduit, and wire. Example \ninstallations are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. \nAlthough it is desirable to minimize the distance \nbetween the electrical panel and EV charging station \nas much as possible, where a charging station is \nlocated on a property can impact how it is used. For \nexample, placing charging station parking spaces in \nthe back of a building might discourage their use, but \nother customers may be upset if a charging station \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 6  These charging station installations (noted by \nred arrows) are sited in convenient, but not prime parking \nspaces that minimize conduit runs to reduce costs \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nFigure 7  Charging stations at parking spaces away from \na building require longer trenching through pavement \n(red lines indicate distance) and could disrupt trafc fow \nduring construction| \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nis installed in prime parking spaces that often remain \nvacant because there are few EV drivers. Charging \nstations in prime parking spaces are also more likely \nto be occupied by non-EVs, as shown in Figure 8. \nOther considerations have less impact on installation \ncosts, but are important to ensure that the charging \nstation is well integrated into the parking lot. Be sure \nto think about the path of the charging cord when in \nuse so it is not a tripping hazard and consider your \nparking lot management practices. For example, \nwhen selecting a site, be sure the charging station \nwill not impede pavement cleaning or snow plowing. \nOn page 6, Figure 9 shows spaces where snow is \npiled in the winter or where equipment might be \nFigure 8  These examples (see red arrows) show charging \nstations that were installed in prime parking spaces that \nwere traditionally used by non-EV drivers \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9  Snow management practices must be considered because snow accumulation can obstruct access to EV charging \nand snow plows can cause damage to charging stations \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nstored that can block access to the charging station. \nFor more in-depth information on considerations for \ncharging station installations, read Site Design for \nElectric Vehicle Charging Stations (nyserda.ny.gov/-/ \nmedia/Files/Programs/ChargeNY/Site-Design-for-EV-\nCharging-Stations.pdf). \n5. What factors fgure into \nan installation estimate? \n5 1  Electrical Factors \nOnly an electrician can determine the fnal electrical \ninstallation costs of an individual situation because \nseveral factors fgure into it. Owners can help by \nidentifying the electrical panels and conduits in the \nbuilding or on the property and current electrical loads \nfor an electrician to assess. In general, installation \ncosts are much higher if additional electrical panel \nmodifcations or new service to the facility are needed. \nFor example, older, outdated panels may need to be \nreplaced and updated before a charging station can be \nsafely added to the system (Figure 11). \nAs shown in Figure 10, it is also good to note whether \nthe electrical panel has available breaker slots  or \nsome marked as spares that could be used for the \ncharging stations. A single Level 2 charging station \nwill require two breaker slots for its 240-volt circuit \nand a dual port charging station will need four slots. \nEach Level 1 charging station will only require a single \nbreaker slot for a 120-volt circuit. \nAvailable space in the electrical panel can indicate, \nbut does not necessarily guarantee, whether there is \nsufcient capacity with the current electrical service \nto add the charging station(s) without requiring an \nupgrade from the utility. The electrician will determine \nthe available electrical capacity with a load calculation \nFigure 10 Older electrical panels, such as these examples, may require upgrades to meet today’s electrical codes \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11  Level 2 Charging Station 240-volt (40 amp) \ncircuits breakers and examples of empty breaker slots \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nEmpty \nSlots \nFigure 12  Charging station circuits may require an added \nsubpanel, such as this one, if space in the main panel is \nlimited \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nand could add a small subpanel (see Figure 12) for \nthe charging station circuit(s) if there is sufcient \ncapacity with the existing service but no space in \nthe main panel. \nIdentifying all electrical panels at the facility will help \nthe electrician to assess viability and/or planning of \nan installation. These panels come in many shapes \nand sizes and can be tied directly to the grid or used \nas sub-panels to further distribute power from larger \npanels. The electrician may determine that one panel \nis better to work with than another, or one may ofer \na shorter electrical run to a good charging station \nlocation, reducing costs. \nAll externally run and most internally run electrical \nwire will have conduit for protection. It will be routed \nalong ceilings and walls inside, pass through the \nbuilding foundation or walls, and buried underground \nuntil it reaches the station. Inside the facility, the \nlength of the run, obstacles (e.g., concrete walls, metal \nI-beams, lights, or fre suppression systems), and \naccessibility should be observed. For outdoor \nrouting, the length of the run, immovable objects \n(e.g., landscaping, tree roots, ponds, or buildings), \nmanmade surfaces (e.g., concrete or pavement), \nutility lines (e.g., electrical, water, or gas), and any \nother obstacles that may complicate trenching \nshould be observed as best as possible. Trenching \nthrough grass, dirt, or gravel is easy to dig and repair. \nMost contractors will tunnel under a short concrete \nsidewalk, but some will cut into it and repair. Wire runs \nacross parking lot pavement are typically longer and \ncould be accomplished by tunneling under or cutting \nand repairing. Samples of trenching work are shown \non page 8 in Figure 13 for dirt, Figure 14 for concrete \nwalkways, and Figure 15 for pavement. \n5 2  Networking and Physical Protection \nAlthough electrical considerations fgure heavily \ninto installation, two additional factors are important. \nFirst, cellular signal strength is an important factor \nfor networked EV charging station installations. \nKey features on a networked station (e.g., fault \nnotifcations, in-use status, user authentication, \npayments, or reservations) will not be available if the \nstation cannot communicate with the central network \nvia cellular signals. When considering where to place \nthe station on the property, use a cell phone to test \nthe available strength and determine if an alternative \nlocation might have a better signal. Charging station \ninstallations in remote locations or in underground \ngarages may have more difculty acquiring a good \ncellular connection. If the charging station cannot \nbe moved into a place with a better cellular signal, \nsome charging manufacturers ofer equipment with \nalternative cellular providers that may have better \n7 \n\n \nFigure 13  Trenching through dirt is considered the easiest outdoor installation of a charging station \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nFigure 14  Charging stations can be installed by cutting and repairing (left and center photos) and tunneling under (right) \nconcrete walkways  \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \nFigure 15  Installing charging stations in parking lots usually requires either cutting and repairing (left and center) and \ntunneling under (right) pavement  \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \n8 \n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstrength at that location. Extended antennae or cell \nsignal boosters can also be used, but these will add \nto the cost of the station installation. \nSecond, some form of charging station protection \nshould be used to prevent cars, snow plows, or \nsweepers from hitting the station or snagging the \ncharging cords. Mounting the station above the \nbumper level on a wall or behind a curb is helpful, \nbut an additional tire stop or bollard would provide \nadditional protection (Figure 16). \nIt is also useful to install a post for signage while the \nstation is being put in. If the location of the station on \nthe property is not obvious to EV drivers, additional \ndirectional signage throughout the property can be \nuseful, but will add additional cost. \n6. What criteria are \nimportant to consider \nin selecting an \nelectrical installer? \nThe installation of an EV charging station is not \nsignifcantly diferent from most electrical work, but \nusing an electrical contractor with knowledge and \nexperience with this technology may lead to a better \ninstallation. As with any electrical work, always use a \nlicensed electrician to ensure they have the proper \nelectrical training and experience. Insurance is also \nimportant, as a charging station can be an expensive \nFigure 16  Bollards, tire stops, and sign posts can be used to protect charging stations and electrical cords from \nphysical damage \nCourtesy Energetics Incorporated \n9 \n\nFigure 17  EV general service signs, regulatory signs, and trailblazing sign \nImages 1-3 (left) courtesy of MUTCD, Images 4-5 (right) courtesy Energetics Incorporated \npiece of equipment to replace should something go \nwrong. When possible, obtain quotes from multiple \nelectricians to compare prices and experience. Consider \nthe installation technique being quoted as some may \nspecify cutting and repair for trenching work whereas \nothers may want to tunnel under so it looks neater. \nWhile charging stations are a relatively new \ntechnology, many electricians have experience \ninstalling these systems. Ask for references and prior \nwork examples to assess their quality of work. Some \nelectrical contractors are certifed installers for a \ncertain charging station manufacturer, and some might \nhave training through the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \nTraining Program (EVITP; www.evitp.org) or another \ngeneral charging station installation course. EVITP \nis a structured platform for delivering training and \ncertifcation for the installation of EV charging stations \nin and around residential, commercial, and public \nfacilities. The EVITP training consists of 24 hours \nof class time and comprehensively addresses the \nrequirements, regulations, products, and strategies to \nmaster successful, expert, and professional customer \nrelations, installation, and maintenance of EV charging \ninfrastructure. The EVITP training highlights Article 625 \nof the National Electric Code, which specifcally applies \nto EV charging stations, along with other relevant \narticles involved in the electrical installation process. \n7. What are best practices\nfor operating and\nmaintaining the\ncharging station?\n7 1  Policies \nCharging station parking spaces should be available \nfor EVs, so it is good to establish a policy that specifes \nenforcement and consequences to restrict other \nvehicles from parking in these spaces. As demand \nfor parking spaces with charging stations increases, \nfurther restrictions may be implemented, such as \nensuring that EVs parked there are actually \ncharging or setting a time limit for how long an \nEV can charge there. \nWhen an EV charging station is placed at a prime \nparking spot, cars with gasoline internal combustion \nengines (ICEs) may use this convenient parking space \nnot knowing that it is reserved for EV charging; EV \nadvocates call this being “ICEd.” To ensure EV drivers \ncan easily navigate to charging stations and are not \n“ICEd” when they arrive, efective signage should be \nused. However, although a sign can inform drivers of \nthe policy, enforcing policy through tickets or towing of \nunauthorized vehicles may be necessary. \nFor more in-depth information on policy options read \nthe Planning Policy Tool Guide (nyserda.ny.gov/-/ \nmedia/Files/Programs/ChargeNY/Planning-and-\nPolicy-Tool-Guide.pdf). \n7 2  Signage \nEfective signage helps EV drivers navigate to EV \ncharging station spaces and helps to prevent EV \ncharging spaces from being occupied by non-EVs \n(Figure 17). Signs in private parking facilities are not \nrequired to meet Federal Highway Administration \n(FHWA) Manual on Uniform Trafc Control Devices \n(MUTCD) standards, but owners and operators are \nencouraged to do so because it promotes uniformity \nand clarity. A blue general service sign should be \nused to provide general guidance to the charging \nstation (using white arrows) and to identify the EV \ncharging space. Regulatory signs are used to enforce \nwhich vehicles are eligible to park in charging station \nparking spots, as well as the time duration that EVs \nare permitted to park and/or charge at the station. \nTrailblazing (special) signs are used to provide drivers \nand visitors with additional information (e.g., funding \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsource, tourism or economic development info, or \nsponsorship) and can include any logos, shapes, and \ncolors as part of the signage theme at the site. Another \nefective strategy for distinguishing the EV charging \nspace is to paint the entire space green or mark the \npavement with an EV charging symbol. \nFor more in-depth information on EV charging station \nsignage, read the Charging Station Signage Overview \n(nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Files/Programs/ChargeNY/ \nEVSE-Signage-Overview.pdf). \n7 3  Usage Fees and Advertising \nRevenue \nEstablishing a fee for the use of the charging \nstation may depend in part on the venue where it is \noperating. Site owners should weigh whether their \nclientele would be willing to pay extra for EV charging \nand whether they need to generate revenue from \nuse or whether the charging station creates value in \nother ways. \nCharging station fees can be per hour, per session, or \nper unit of electricity. If charging per hour, the cost of \nenergy may vary widely by charging session because \ndiferent EVs receive electricity at diferent rates. \nCharging per session is usually more appropriate for \nworkplace charging or charging stations that have very \nshort, regular sessions. Charging by unit of energy \n(usually kilowatt-hour [kWh]) accurately accounts for \nthe true cost of electricity for the charging station \nowner, but does not give an incentive for a car that is \nfully charged to leave the space. Some site owners \nhave tried combinations of these approaches, such \nas charging a fat rate for the frst two hours, then an \nincreasing rate for longer sessions. Some locations \nmight prefer to ofer free charging, either as an \nadditional draw or to lower operating expenses by not \nneeding to join a charging station network. \nCharging stations ofer a number of ways to generate \nvalue beyond just charging for use. Installing charging \nstations can attract EV drivers who then patronize \nyour business, retain valuable employees, and \nprovide a sense of your environmental stewardship. In \naddition, some station owners have sold advertising \nspace on their charging stations, creating a new \nrevenue stream. \n11 \n\n\n \n \n \nNew York State Energy Research and Development \nAuthority (NYSERDA), a public beneft corporation, \nofers objective information and analysis, innovative \nprograms, technical expertise, and support to help \nNew Yorkers increase energy efciency, save money, \nuse renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels.

As a result, plug‐in \nelectric vehicle (PEV) owners can have difficulty locating EVSE to charge their vehicles. When \nEVSE is placed at prime parking spots to advertise a “green image” or to attract usage rather \nthan close to a power source, an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle may use this \nconvenient parking space not knowing that it is reserved for PEV charging; PEV advocates call \nthis being “ICEd”. To ensure PEV drivers can easily navigate to EVSE parking spots and are not \n“ICEd” when they arrive, state and local \ngovernments are finding ways to add effective \nsignage. \nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \nregulates the nation’s design and usage of traffic \ncontrol devices using the Manual on Uniform \nTraffic Control Devices (MUTCD)i. EVSE signs are \ntraffic control devices and are therefore under the \nregulatory authority of the FHWA through the \nMUTCD. The MUTCD contains the minimum \nstandards for use that each entity looking to install \nsignage on any street and highway open to the \npublic must follow. \nThere are three different types of signage \napplicable to EVSE: General Service or Guidance \nSigns, Regulatory or Enforceable Signs, and Special \nor Information/Trailblazer Signs. Each of these \nserves a different unique purpose. \nGeneral Service Signs \nGeneral Service signs are intended to provide general guidance to the charging station and \nshould be installed at a suitable distance in advance of the turn‐off or intersecting roadway, or \nat the charging station. The color format for general service signs for users on public streets is as \nfollows: \nBackground: Blue  \nLetters, Symbols, Arrows, and Borders: White  \nThe current revision of the MUTCD has approved the EVSE signage shown in Figure 2. The \nstandard size for the Electric Vehicle Charging sign (D9‐11b) is 24 inches wide by 24 inches high \n(24” x 24”) on a conventional road, 30” x 30” on a freeway or expressway, and 12” x 12” at a \nparking facility. For the Electric Vehicle Charging plaque (D9‐11bP) the standard size is 24” x 18” \non a conventional road, 30” x 24” on a freeway or expressway, and 16” x 12” at a parking \nfacility. \nFigure  1:  Federal  Highway  Administration's   \nManual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devicesi   \n1  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: MUTCD approved General Service signs \nFigure 3: California Supplemental \nand plaques for EVSEi \nEVSE General Service sign \nCalifornia’s MUTCD 2012 Editionii included an additional General Service sign for EVSE (G66‐21) \nas shown in Figure 3, which uses the standard sizes of 24” x 24” on a conventional road, 30” x \n30” on a freeway or expressway, and 12” x 12” at a parking facility.

However, signs have been developed for testing \nin Michigan, Oregon, and Washington (see Figure 5). Regulatory Signs can be further broken \ndown into two categories. Green/white regulatory parking signs are considered permissive signs \nand are intended to provide motorists with the allowable time and days to park. \nRed/black/white regulatory parking signs are prohibitive and are intended to advise motorists of \nan action that shall not be taken. \n2  \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nFigure  5:  Regulatory  signs  developed  for  testing  in  Michigan,  Oregon,  and  Washingtoniii  \nTo be enforceable, Regulatory signs should be no smaller than 12” x 18” and placed immediately \nadjacent to the EVSE at a height of 7 feet as prescribed in Part 2, Chapter 2A.18 of the federal \nMUTCD. The first two signs in Figure 5 would allow for the parking of a PEV without being \nplugged in (could be used as a “wait to charge” spot next to the charging station), whereas the \nthird sign requires the PEV to be plugged in and charging. The second sign in Figure 5 is \npatterned after the standard sign that reserves parking for persons with disabilities. The last \nexample in Figure 5 is a permissive sign that could be used to designate the number of hours \nand days a PEV is permitted to stay connected to the charger. In June 2013, the FHWA released \nrecommendations for MUTCD compliant EVSE signage to be used until the next Notice of \nProposed Amendment to the MUTCD. These signs are presented in Figure 6 below. \nFigure 6: MUTCD Temporary Recommended Regulatory Signage \nThe MUTCD approved signage only includes word legends, due to the lack of a symbol which can \neffectively convey regulations associated with EVSE and parking facilities. Symbols that have not \nbeen adopted in the MUTCD cannot be used outside of official tested applications.iv To be in \ncompliance with MUTCD standards, permissive signs may be used in combination with a \nprohibitive sign, as long as they are installed below or to the right of the prohibitive sign. The \ninstaller must have approval from the roadway section owner to install a sign on a roadway.

As a result, they may include other logos, shapes, and colors as part \nof the signage theme at the site. Special signs must not be prominent, and should be placed to \nthe side or below the regulatory signs.

Figure 10 shows a sample sign stack.ix It is also important to \nconsider that adding more signs could just add to “sign clutter” at intersections. \nThe general public may not recognize EVSE locations that only have friendly green \nor blue “EV Parking” or “EV Parking Only” signs. If the signage is blue in color, it \ncan be mistaken for an ADA‐accessible location. Green signs are often mistaken for \nshort‐term parking signs. Including a Regulatory sign is recommended. \nSigns in private parking facilities for public use are not required to meet MUTCD \nstandards, but owners and operators are encouraged to do so. Signs with different \nshapes, colors, and messages than those listed in the MUTCD may be posted in \nprivate facilities, but cannot be legally enforceable. State and local agencies are \nallowed to create their own custom word message signs if there are none \navailable. \nFigure 10: Sample \nsign stackix \nTo introduce new signage, an entity can submit an inquiry to the \nFHWA to experiment with a new design (see Section 1A.10 of the \nMUTCD)i. The FHWA gave interim approval through this inquiry \nprocess to the California signage D9‐11b in Figure 11. This is \nintended to replace the original EVSE symbol (see Error! Reference \nsource not found.), as it provides clearer indication of the electrical \naspect of EVSE. California’s version of D9‐11b has been received \nfavorably by the EV community and is widely preferred over FHWA \nMUTCD’s version of D9‐11b. \nThere is debate on the effectiveness of “hybrid signs”, as pictured in \nFigure 12. ECOtality has found that combining the symbol and \nregulatory sign provides an efficient, cost effective, and aesthetically \npleasing appearance to the charging station. Plug In America noted in \nthe Clean Cities Signage Webinar in October 2012: “Cramming a lot of \ninfo onto one sign will run you into a serious lack of MUTCD standards \ncompliance”.viii \nAs EVSE deployment accelerates, MUTCD approved signs will increase \nin both quantity and clarity. \nFigure  11:  Interim‐approved  \nEVSE  signage  D9‐11bv   \nFigure  12:  ECOtality’s  sample  \n\"hybrid\"  signviii  \n5  \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \ni Federal Highway Administration.
